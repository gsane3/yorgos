# yorgos.ai Backend Spec

## Status

- Current production app flow: localStorage MVP. No database-backed CRM data in the main app. No server-side auth in AppShell or app pages.
- Backend foundation: partially implemented and isolated from the MVP app. Standalone backend test surfaces exist and have been manually verified.
- Main AppShell: not backend-aware. All routing still uses localStorage userProfile.
- Do not claim backend is connected to the main app. Standalone test pages only.
- This document defines the target v2 backend direction and is the handoff reference for backend implementation.
- Product target: managed business phone + CRM + AI assistant. Each business gets a Yorgos-managed phone number. Users receive and place calls through the Yorgos app. In-app calling is the target product experience. Forwarding to a mobile is transitional/fallback only.
- Private beta v1 target includes Voice with automatic AI call brief and Viber intake link delivery. Viber is for intake link delivery only, not a general messaging inbox. SMS is fallback/v1.1. See [VOICE_SMS_ARCHITECTURE.md](./VOICE_SMS_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the detailed architecture, calling modes, Inter Telecom/PBX voice strategy, and Apifon Viber intake flow reference.
- Voice pipeline and PBX/WebRTC calling layer are not implemented. Blocked by: CRM backend schema (Phase 3), managed number model commercial/legal confirmation, PBX/calling mode decision, webhook infrastructure, transcription jobs, AI brief jobs, Apifon production sender activation, and legal/consent gate.
- Voice provider strategy: Inter Telecom SIP trunk is technically confirmed (Greek numbers, inbound/outbound, 15 EUR/year, 2 channels, inbound free, recording on our PBX allowed). Telnyx is paused. The managed multi-number model where Yorgos manages numbers for multiple businesses still needs commercial/legal confirmation from Inter Telecom. Provider-test webhook endpoints exist: `/api/webhooks/voice/telnyx` and `/api/webhooks/apifon/status`.
- Apifon Viber integration: OAuth, Viber send, Greek UTF-8, and callback_url are confirmed working in manual testing with test sender "Apifon Demo" (cap limit 20). Production sender not yet activated.

### Implemented backend foundation (manually verified)

- Supabase package installed (`@supabase/supabase-js`)
- Supabase browser helper (`createBrowserSupabaseClient`)
- Supabase server helper (`createServerSupabaseClient`, service role, server-only)
- Initial schema migration: `supabase/migrations/001_initial.sql` (businesses + business_users + RLS)
- Data API grants migration: `supabase/migrations/002_grants.sql`
- `GET /api/businesses/me` -- reads authenticated user's business via bearer token
- `POST /api/businesses` -- creates business + business_users row via bearer token
- `/register` -- standalone Supabase Auth sign up page
- `/login/backend` -- standalone Supabase Auth sign in page + logout
- `/auth/confirm` -- standalone email confirmation callback (verifyOtp + exchangeCodeForSession)
- `/onboarding/backend` -- standalone session test: POST /api/businesses
- `/business/backend` -- standalone session test: GET /api/businesses/me
- `/backend` -- standalone developer hub linking all backend test pages
- Logout implemented on all session-bearing standalone backend pages
- `GET /api/webhooks/voice/telnyx` -- health check (provider test endpoint, no DB writes)
- `POST /api/webhooks/voice/telnyx` -- receives Telnyx Voice API events, verifies Ed25519 signature, returns summary (provider test endpoint, no DB writes)
- `GET /api/webhooks/apifon/status` -- health check (provider test endpoint, no DB writes)
- `POST /api/webhooks/apifon/status` -- receives Apifon Viber status callbacks, parses confirmed payload shape, returns summary (provider test endpoint, no DB writes)

### Still standalone / not integrated

- AppShell is still localStorage-only. Zero Supabase imports.
- MVP `/login` remains mock (name + email, no password, no Supabase)
- MVP `/onboarding` remains localStorage-only
- Customers, tasks, and offers remain localStorage-only
- No backend data migration from browser storage yet
- No main app backend routing yet (AppShell integration blocked -- see AppShell Readiness Gate section)
- No password reset flow yet

---

## Recommended Stack

- **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + Storage + Edge Functions)
- **Next.js API routes** for business logic and provider webhooks
- **Resend** for transactional email (already partially integrated)
- **Deployment target TBD** for Next.js hosting. Choose after backend foundation and pilot requirements are clear.

---

## Why This Path

- Fastest path to first real user: Supabase Auth + Postgres are ready-to-use.
- Postgres is the right database for relational CRM data (customers, tasks, offers, communications).
- Row Level Security (RLS) enforces multi-tenant data isolation at the database level, not just in application code.
- Keeps the existing Next.js app structure. No new server framework.
- Postgres schema is portable. Not locked to Supabase-specific data format.
- Better fit than Firebase for relational CRM (Firebase Firestore is document-based, relational joins are expensive).
- Less overhead than a custom Node backend at this product stage.
- Pilot-friendly cost profile. Verify pricing before production.

---

## Current MVP Architecture

### Data storage
- All CRM data is stored in a single localStorage key: `yorgos_ai_mvp_state`
- Data is browser-local. Lost on browser clear or device change.
- No server-side database, no auth, no team sharing.

### Existing real API routes
| Route | Purpose | Requires |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `POST /api/ai/review` | AI brief extraction via Anthropic | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `POST /api/ai/cmd` | Natural language CRM commands | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `POST /api/email/send-offer` | Transactional email via Resend | `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM` |

### Current reality
- AI works only when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured. Falls back to 503 no_api_key.
- Email sending works only when `RESEND_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM` are configured. Falls back to copy-paste draft.
- FROM address is always the configured yorgos.ai sender. User business email or domain is not used as FROM.
- Calls are mock/demo only. `CallRecord.isMock` is hardcoded `true` in the TypeScript type.
- No live lead imports. Only manual entry and CSV upload.
- No auth, no database, no team sharing.

---

## Target Data Model

All tables (except auth system tables) include `business_id` for multi-tenancy.
Tables are introduced in phases. Do not build all at once.

### `businesses` - Phase 1
- Purpose: One row per business account.
- Key fields: `id`, `owner_id` (references auth.users), `name`, `type`, `phone`, `email`, `address`, `vat_number`, `default_vat_rate`, `sending_domain` (future), `sending_from_email` (future), `business_phone_number` (future).
- Constraint: `owner_id` unique (one business per user in Phase 1).
- Index: `owner_id`.

### `business_users` - Phase 1 (owner only), Phase 4 (teams)
- Purpose: Links users to businesses with a role. Enables future team support.
- Key fields: `business_id`, `user_id`, `role` (owner/admin/member), `invited_at`, `accepted_at`.
- Constraint: PRIMARY KEY (`business_id`, `user_id`).
- Phase 1: insert only owner row on business creation. No invitation UI yet.

### `customers` - Phase 3
- Purpose: CRM contacts. Replaces localStorage customers array.
- Key fields: `id`, `business_id`, `crm_number`, `name`, `company_name`, `phone`, `mobile_phone`, `email`, `address`, `source`, `external_lead_id` (future: Meta/Google ID for dedupe), `status`, `opportunity_value`, `needs_summary`, `notes`, `last_contact_at`, `intake_status`.
- Index: `(business_id, phone)`, `(business_id, email)`.
- RLS: users can only see rows where `business_id` matches their business.

### `tasks` - Phase 3
- Purpose: Follow-up tasks, appointments, send-offer reminders. Replaces localStorage tasks array.
- Key fields: `id`, `business_id`, `customer_id`, `offer_id`, `title`, `type`, `status`, `priority`, `due_date`, `due_time`, `note`, `created_from_ai`, `completed_at`.
- Index: `(business_id, customer_id, status)`.

### `offers` - Phase 3
- Purpose: Price proposals sent to customers. Replaces localStorage offers array.
- Key fields: `id`, `business_id`, `customer_id`, `offer_number`, `status`, `offer_date`, `valid_until`, `items` (jsonb), `subtotal`, `vat_rate`, `vat_amount`, `total`, `notes`, `terms`, `acceptance_text`, `created_from_ai`.
- Index: `(business_id, customer_id, status)`.

### `communications` - Phase 3
- Purpose: Outbound/inbound communication log (SMS, call summaries, email records).
- Key fields: `id`, `business_id`, `customer_id`, `channel`, `direction`, `status`, `phone`, `summary`, `created_at`.
- Note: call records will no longer be hardcoded as mock once real calls are implemented (Phase 6).

### `email_send_logs` - Phase 4
- Purpose: Audit log for every email sent via `/api/email/send-offer`.
- Key fields: `id`, `business_id`, `customer_id`, `offer_id`, `from_address`, `reply_to`, `to_address`, `subject`, `status`, `provider_id` (Resend message ID), `sent_at`, `error_message`.
- Index: `(business_id, offer_id)`.
- Note: Enables right-to-erasure audit and retry logic.

### `lead_source_connections` - Phase 5
- Purpose: Stores OAuth tokens and webhook config for lead source integrations.
- Key fields: `id`, `business_id`, `source_type` (meta/google/tiktok/website_form), `access_token_encrypted`, `refresh_token_encrypted`, `page_or_form_id`, `webhook_secret`, `is_active`, `last_synced_at`.
- Security: tokens must be encrypted at rest (server-side encryption key, not stored in Postgres plaintext).
- Phase 5 only. Do not build OAuth flows until provider app reviews are approved.

### `business_phone_numbers` - Phase 6
- Purpose: Tracks provisioned VoIP numbers.
- Key fields: `id`, `business_id`, `number`, `provider`, `provider_sid`, `status`, `forward_to`, `working_hours` (jsonb), `created_at`.
- Phase 6 only. Do not build until consent design and legal review are complete.

---

## Tenancy and Auth Plan

- Supabase Auth manages users (`auth.users`). No custom user table.
- Phase 1: one user = one business. Simple 1:1.
- `business_users` table exists from the beginning, but only the owner row is inserted on signup. No invitation UI yet.
- Phase 4+: team invitations, role-based access (owner/admin/member).
- `/demo` must remain accessible without auth. Do not put the demo behind a login gate.
- AppShell currently checks `localStorage.userProfile`. After Phase 2, this check is replaced by a Supabase session check.
- AppShell redirect: if no session, redirect to `/login` (not `/demo`) for real users. `/demo` stays open.

---

## Row Level Security Pattern

Every business-owned table follows this pattern:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: authenticated user can access rows belonging to their business
CREATE POLICY "business_members_only" ON customers
  USING (
    business_id IN (
      SELECT business_id FROM business_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

- Every table with user data has `business_id`.
- RLS enforces isolation at the database level. Application bugs cannot leak cross-business data.
- Service-role key is used only in server-side API routes. Never expose to browser.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` stays in server env vars only. `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is safe for browser.

---

## LocalStorage Migration Plan

Migration is explicit and user-triggered. Never automatic.

### Flow
1. User logs in to backend account.
2. App detects browser has localStorage data and no migration marker.
3. Settings page shows migration banner: "Τα δεδομένα σου είναι τοπικά. Θέλεις να τα μεταφέρεις στο cloud account σου;"
4. User clicks confirm.
5. App reads localStorage, shows summary: "X πελάτες, Y tasks, Z προσφορές."
6. User confirms transfer.
7. Client sends local JSON to `POST /api/migrate/from-browser`.
8. Server validates all records before inserting. Rejects if validation fails.
9. Server inserts records with old-ID-to-new-ID mapping to preserve relationships.
10. Client stores `migrated_at` timestamp in localStorage to prevent duplicate imports.
11. Subsequent app loads read from backend, not localStorage.

### Safeguards
- Server rejects migration if business already has data (no overwrite).
- Migration endpoint rate-limited: once per hour per business.
- Demo records (`isDemo: true`) are skipped by default. User can opt to include them.
- Partial failures roll back entirely (transaction).
- No automatic migration. Explicit user consent required.

---

## Email Sending Plan

### Phase 1-3 (current behavior)
- Keep existing `POST /api/email/send-offer` Resend route.
- FROM remains the configured yorgos.ai sender address.
- Reply-To can be set to business email if safe (read from `businesses.email`).
- No Gmail, Outlook, SMTP, OAuth, or business-domain sending. Not implemented and not claimed.

### Phase 4
- Add `email_send_logs` table.
- Modify send route to write a log row before and after each send attempt.
- Expose `GET /api/email/send-logs` for the business to see send history.

### Future (Phase 5+)
- `businesses.sending_domain`: user verifies their domain via DNS TXT/CNAME records.
- Once verified, Resend sends FROM `name@verified-domain.com`.
- `businesses.sending_from_email`: the FROM address when domain is verified.
- Do not claim this is implemented until verification flow is complete.

---

## Lead Import Plan

### Phase 5, in order

**Step 1: Generic lead intake endpoint**

```
POST /api/webhooks/lead-intake
Authorization: Bearer <business_api_key>
Body: { name, phone, email, source, notes, external_lead_id }
```

- Creates or updates a Customer row.
- Creates a `call_back` Task linked to the customer.
- Dedupe: normalize phone to E.164, lowercase email. Check existing customers for match before insert.
- Returns `{ ok: true, customer_id, task_id, action: "created" | "updated" }`.

**Step 2: Provider-specific adapters**
- `POST /api/webhooks/meta` -- validates Meta signature, maps fields, calls generic intake.
- `POST /api/webhooks/google` -- same for Google Lead Form.
- `POST /api/webhooks/tiktok` -- same for TikTok Lead Ads.
- `POST /api/webhooks/website-form` -- generic form embed endpoint.

### What not to build first
- OAuth flows for Meta/Google (requires app review from provider. Takes weeks).
- Polling (webhook-only for Phase 5).
- Any paid ad spend data.

---

## Business Phone Plan

Yorgos provides each business with a managed phone number. This is not just call logging. Each business owner receives a dedicated Greek number provisioned through the Yorgos platform. They receive and place calls through the app. The call pipeline creates transcriptions and AI briefs automatically.

Two calling modes are planned (not implemented yet):
- Mode A (forwarding fallback): PBX receives call and forwards to professional's mobile. Simpler to implement. Limitation: professional sees the platform number, not the original caller's number.
- Mode B (in-app calling target): user receives and places calls through the Yorgos app via WebRTC. CRM context visible during call. This is the intended product experience.

Voice provider: Inter Telecom SIP trunk is technically confirmed. Greek numbers available. Inbound/outbound forwarding supported. 15 EUR/year per geographic number, 2 channels included, inbound free, recording on our PBX allowed. The managed multi-number model (Yorgos managing numbers for multiple businesses) still needs commercial and legal confirmation from Inter Telecom.

Viber is for customer intake link delivery only. It is NOT a general messaging inbox. After the AI call brief, if required customer fields are missing, the system creates a secure intake link and delivers it via Viber (planned, not implemented in production). Apifon is the primary Viber provider. SMS is fallback/v1.1.

See [VOICE_SMS_ARCHITECTURE.md](./VOICE_SMS_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full voice architecture, calling modes, Inter Telecom confirmed details, Apifon Viber intake delivery status, and legal/consent gate requirements.

Blocked by: CRM backend schema (Phase 3), managed number model commercial/legal confirmation, PBX/calling mode decision, webhook infrastructure, transcription jobs, AI brief jobs, Apifon production sender activation, and legal/consent gate.

**Do not build recording or transcription until consent design and legal review are complete.**

### Phase 6 sequence (managed business phone foundation, after calling mode and PBX decision)
1. Confirm managed number model with Inter Telecom commercially/legally. Decide calling mode (Mode A forwarding or Mode B in-app WebRTC). Select PBX technology.
2. Define `PhoneProvider` interface (SIP/PBX adapter for Mode A/B, CPaaS adapter if applicable).
3. Create `business_phone_numbers` table.
4. Build call routing and forwarding config (CPaaS or PBX bridge).
5. Build call log (real calls, not mock).
6. Recording: only after consent flow design, legal review, and PBX recording rights confirmed.

### What is in current MVP
- `CallRecord.isMock: true` hardcoded. All calls are mock/demo.
- Native `tel:` links for outbound calls (device dialer only).
- No real VoIP, no recording, no voicemail, no transcription.

### What not to build until legal decisions are made
- Call recording (requires consent notice before call, immutable consent log, GDPR erasure support).
- AI transcription of real calls (separate data retention policy needed).
- Voicemail storage.
- PSTN termination (requires carrier contract).

---

## Privacy and Legal Boundaries

- No hidden recording. Consent must be obtained before any recording begins.
- No GDPR compliance claims before legal review and implementation of right-to-erasure endpoint.
- Raw audio must not be stored by default. Only store recording metadata (duration, consent status) until storage policy is decided.
- Transcripts are not final CRM data by default. They are drafts for user review.
- Right-to-erasure workflow and audit logs are required before commercial production.
- OAuth tokens for lead source connections must be encrypted server-side before storing in database.
- Do not send customer PII in logs or error messages.
- Greece and EU: GDPR applies. A DPA is needed with any sub-processor (AI provider, email provider, SMS provider, phone provider).
- This document does not constitute legal advice. Get legal review before commercial launch.

## Phased Roadmap

### Phase 0 -- Backend docs and project setup [COMPLETE]
- Goal: Architecture decisions documented. Supabase project created (manual). Env vars planned.
- Allowed areas: docs, `.env.example`, Supabase project dashboard (not code).
- Validation: This document exists. Supabase project URL and anon key are available.
- Status: Complete. Supabase project created. `.env.local` configured locally. `.env.example` updated.

### Phase 1 -- Supabase client, env setup, initial schema [COMPLETE]
- Goal: Supabase client helpers. `.env.example` updated. First migration SQL for `businesses` and `business_users` tables. Business profile API.

- Validation: Create a customer, refresh page, customer is still there (from backend, not localStorage).
- Not yet: Lead imports, phone, email logs, teams.

### Phase 4 -- Email logs and migration tool
- Goal: `email_send_logs` table. Migration endpoint. Migration UI in Settings.
- Allowed areas: `src/app/api/email/`, `src/app/api/migrate/`, `src/app/(app)/settings/page.tsx`.
- Validation: Send an email, verify log row exists. Migrate browser data, verify records appear in backend.
- Not yet: Domain verification, team invitations.

- Goal: `POST /api/webhooks/lead-intake`. `lead_source_connections` table. Webhook signature validation.
- Allowed areas: `src/app/api/webhooks/`, supabase migrations.
- Validation: POST to endpoint with test payload, customer appears in CRM.
- Not yet: Meta/Google OAuth (provider app review required), TikTok, polling.

### Phase 6 -- Business phone foundation (after legal/provider decisions)
- Goal: `PhoneProvider` abstraction. `business_phone_numbers` table. Number provisioning UI. Call capture. Recording metadata (no audio yet). Webhook infrastructure. Provider event log. Consent events.
- Allowed areas: `src/lib/phone/`, `src/app/api/webhooks/voice/`, `src/app/api/webhooks/sms/`, supabase migrations.
- Validation: Sandbox number provisioned. Inbound call webhook received and stored. Customer matched or created from caller number.
- Not yet: Recording download and storage. Transcription. AI brief. SMS messages.
- Blocked until: Provider selected. Consent announcement reviewed by lawyer.

### Phase 7 -- Voice to CRM pipeline with Viber intake link delivery (v1 track, required for private beta)
- Goal: Full call-to-CRM flow (Inter Telecom SIP/PBX or CPaaS provider). Recording download. Transcription jobs. AI brief jobs. ai_draft task creation. Customer intake link schema and API. Viber intake link delivery via Apifon. Customer timeline UI with calls, transcripts, briefs, and intake link status.
- Allowed areas: `src/app/api/jobs/`, `src/app/api/calls/`, `src/app/api/customer-intake-links/`, `src/app/api/viber/`, `src/lib/viber/`, `src/lib/phone/`, supabase migrations, customer profile UI.
- Validation: Real call ends. Brief appears in CRM within acceptable latency. User can confirm or dismiss brief. ai_draft tasks visible. Intake link created and Viber message sent via Apifon manual approval. Customer opens intake form and submits. Customer profile updated.
- Not yet: Outbound SMS (v1.1 fallback). Inbound SMS (v1.1 fallback).
- Blocked until: Phase 6 complete (Inter Telecom SIP/PBX confirmed). Transcription provider DPA signed. AI model DPA signed. Apifon production sender activated and DPA signed. Legal/consent gate complete before production recording or Viber messaging.
- See: [VOICE_SMS_ARCHITECTURE.md](./VOICE_SMS_ARCHITECTURE.md) for database model, API plan, AI brief pipeline, Inter Telecom/PBX strategy, Apifon Viber intake delivery, and legal gate details.

---

## AppShell Readiness Gate

Before editing `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`, all of the following must be satisfied:

- **Backend/localStorage mode separation**: The app must know which mode a given session is in. If both a Supabase session and a localStorage userProfile exist simultaneously, a defined priority rule must exist.
- **Backend-aware login strategy**: The main `/login` is still mock MVP login (name + email, no password). A backend user must never be redirected there. Either a combined login page or a clear routing rule must exist before AppShell routes backend users.
- **Async session loading state**: AppShell currently redirects synchronously. Adding `getSession()` (async) requires a loading state that holds all redirects until the session check resolves. Without it, a valid backend user may be redirected to `/demo` on first render.
- **Missing Supabase config fallback**: If `createBrowserSupabaseClient()` throws (missing env vars), AppShell must catch it and fall back to localStorage-only behavior. It must not crash or redirect incorrectly.
- **Logout path inside main app**: A logout action must exist in the main app UI (sidebar, settings, or BottomNav) for backend users. Logout from the main app must cleanly reset session state.
- **Token expiry/refresh behavior**: Defined behavior when a session expires mid-use. Options: silent redirect to `/login/backend`, or inline session-expired error. Must not redirect to the mock `/login`.
- **Browser localStorage migration strategy**: A backend-logged-in user entering the main app will see empty data. The localStorage migration flow (Phase 4) must be built, or the empty-state UX must be clearly designed, before AppShell routes backend users into the app.
- **Manual QA**: After AppShell changes, confirm that `/demo` remains public, localStorage MVP users are unaffected, missing Supabase config falls back gracefully, and backend session + localStorage data coexist without conflict.

---

## First Implementation Sequence

1. Add `src/lib/supabase.ts` with anon client and server client helpers.
2. Update `.env.example` with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
3. Create `supabase/migrations/001_initial.sql` with `businesses` and `business_users` tables and RLS.
4. Add `GET /api/businesses/me` route (returns current user's business from Supabase).
5. Add login page at `src/app/login/page.tsx`.
6. Add register/onboarding flow.
7. Update `AppShell` to check Supabase session instead of localStorage `userProfile`.

---

## Open Decisions

These must be resolved before starting Phase 1 implementation:

- **Supabase region**: EU (eu-central-1 Frankfurt recommended for GDPR compliance). Confirm before creating project.
- **Deployment target**: choose after backend foundation and pilot requirements are clear.
- **Email provider final setup**: Resend is integrated. Decide whether to stay on Resend or evaluate alternatives before Phase 4 domain verification.
- **Calling mode decision**: decide whether v1 starts with Mode A (forwarding, simpler, known caller ID limitation) or Mode B (in-app WebRTC, target product, higher complexity). Decide before Phase 6 implementation.
- **PBX technology choice**: Asterisk/FreePBX vs FreeSWITCH vs managed PBX with recording API. Inter Telecom ePBX is ruled out (no recording API). Decide before Phase 6.
- **Managed number model confirmation**: confirm with Inter Telecom that Yorgos can manage numbers for multiple businesses through a single SIP trunk. Confirm per-business verification requirements and commercial/legal terms. This is blocking Phase 6.
- **Caller ID limitation with forwarding**: in Mode A, the professional sees the platform number, not the original caller's number. Decide whether this is acceptable for private beta or whether Mode B must be in place first.
- **Viber intake provider**: Apifon is active for testing (OAuth and send confirmed). Confirm Apifon production sender activation, DPA, and pricing before Phase 7 Viber delivery. Yuboto is the backup option.
- **Legal review owner**: Who reviews privacy policy, DPA, GDPR compliance, and recording consent design? Must be assigned before commercial launch.
- **Production privacy policy**: Not yet written. Required before any real user data is collected.
- **Pilot data migration**: Decide whether pilot user browser data should be migrated to the backend, or whether pilot users start fresh on the backend. Both options are valid. Document the decision.
