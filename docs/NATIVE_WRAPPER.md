# Native app (Android / iOS) — wrapper runbook

The web app is already **native-wrapper ready** (installable PWA, mobile viewport, safe-area insets, app-like navigation). The fastest path to "downloadable on Android/iOS" is a **Capacitor** wrapper that loads the live web app, then progressively adds native capabilities (push, native dialer) later.

A `capacitor.config.json` is already in the repo. It points the native shell at the production URL (`server.url`). **Change `appId` and `server.url` to your real values before building.**

## One-time setup (needs a Mac for iOS)

```bash
# 1. Install Capacitor + platforms
npm i @capacitor/core
npm i -D @capacitor/cli
npm i @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios

# 2. Add the native projects (creates /android and /ios)
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios        # macOS + Xcode only

# 3. App icons + splash from the existing brand icon
npm i -D @capacitor/assets
# put a 1024x1024 PNG at assets/icon.png and assets/splash.png, then:
npx cap assets generate

# 4. Sync config into the native projects whenever config changes
npx cap sync
```

## Build & run

```bash
npx cap open android   # opens Android Studio → Run / Build → Generate Signed Bundle (.aab)
npx cap open ios       # opens Xcode → Product > Archive → Distribute
```

## Submitting

- **Google Play**: create a Play Console account ($25 one-time), upload the signed `.aab`, fill store listing, roll out to internal testing first.
- **Apple App Store**: enroll in the Apple Developer Program ($99/yr), archive in Xcode, upload via TestFlight for internal testing, then submit for review.

## Important notes

- **Apple guideline 4.2 (minimum functionality):** a pure web-view wrapper can be rejected for public release. For internal pilots use **TestFlight** (no review friction). For public release, add native value first — the obvious candidates here are **native push notifications** (`@capacitor/push-notifications`) for offer/appointment responses, and later a **native calling layer**.
- **Deep links:** register the public link routes so Viber links open cleanly — `/intake/*`, `/offer-response/*`, `/appointment-response/*`, `/upload/*`. Use Android App Links + iOS Universal Links (associate your domain) so taps can open in-app; otherwise they open in the mobile browser (which is fine — those pages are standalone).
- **Store badges:** the landing page badges (`src/components/marketing/StoreBadges.tsx`) currently link to `/register`. Replace `PLAY_STORE_URL` / `APP_STORE_URL` with the real store URLs after publishing.
- **Auth in the wrapper:** Supabase OAuth redirects must include the app's origin. Add your production domain (and any custom scheme) to Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration → Redirect URLs.

## Alternative: Android TWA (no Mac needed for Android)

For Android only, a **Trusted Web Activity** (via Bubblewrap) ships the PWA straight from the manifest with no web-view chrome. Good for a fast Android-first launch:

```bash
npm i -g @bubblewrap/cli
bubblewrap init --manifest https://app.yorgos.ai/manifest.webmanifest
bubblewrap build
```
