# deskop.ai Product Spec

Last refreshed: 2026-05-24
Current scope: backend-backed AI phone assistant pilot.

## Product summary

deskop.ai helps Greek professionals who handle many phone calls turn conversations into customer history, tasks, appointments, offers and follow-up messages.

The product should prove one main idea:

A professional can run their phone-driven business through an AI assistant that listens, summarizes, organizes and prepares actions for review.

## Product pillars

### 1. Assistant-first, not CRM-first

The user should think:

> What needs to happen next?

Not:

> I need to update my CRM.

CRM exists under the hood. The user experience should feel like a business assistant.

### 2. Phone-first

Calls are the strongest product wedge.

The product should treat every call as a business event:
- who called
- when they called
- what they asked
- what must happen next
- whether they need an offer
- whether they need an appointment
- whether they need follow-up

### 3. Mobile-first

The first real use case is a professional on the road.

The app must work well on a phone:
- fast
- simple
- thumb-friendly
- readable
- minimal admin
- clear next action

### 4. Sector-aware

The user chooses a sector during setup.

The sector controls:
- terminology
- default task types
- offer style
- customer fields
- automation suggestions
- message templates
- AI tone

First sector:
- technical services and call-heavy professionals.

Later sectors:
- accountants
- real estate agents
- spare parts businesses
- doctors
- takeaway
- construction
- other local service businesses

### 5. Review-first AI

AI can suggest. The user approves.

Default:
- no automatic CRM save without review
- no automatic provider send without review
- no automatic appointment confirmation without review

Later:
- explicit automation rules may allow auto-send for selected workflows.

### 6. Consent-first call recording

Call recording is core, but must not be hidden.

The product must support clear notice or consent depending on legal and provider setup.

No legal compliance claim should be made before legal review.
